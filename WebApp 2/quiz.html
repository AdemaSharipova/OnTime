So it’s no wonder that getting into a musical hobby will boost your mental health!It’s a versatile medium that can respond to any feelings you have – from the heavy impact of percussion, to the calm strum of a ukulele, or even the purposeful fidgeting at piano keys – creating sound and music can help you work through heavy emotions and balance any mood.</p></div>

The good thing about this hobby is that you can continually monetize it. People would be glad to pay for your artwork, and it could eventually turn into a real side-hustle. But you don't have to overthink the financial aspects. An artist needs creative space and peace of mind to deliver their best. So, it's best to focus on what makes you happy instead of what can earn you more money. </p></div>

Starting a writing or journaling practice is a great way to express yourself, and there’s no telling what might come out once you sit down and put pen to paper, or fingers to keyboard.Writing in a journal can be especially helpful when you’re trying to cope with anxiety and depression.</p></div>
